GitHub Guides - Hello world

My name is Alyx and I'm 30 years old. This is a very boring beginning because I am not good at selling myself. I have gone through a lot over the last few years and am ready and have the resources to get my life back on track. I am hoping to get accepted into the Ada developer program, though I am worried how my anxiety will react. I have no fears about class time, but internships and eventually a career will be difficult. That being said, difficult does not mean impossible. I have a great support system and a growing set of tools to deal with various issues that come up related to my anxiety.
Right now I am practicing GitHub and hope to move onto Markdown, both of which are required on the Ada application.
